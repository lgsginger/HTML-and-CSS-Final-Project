                   <h2>Did you know?</h2>
                        <p>Pugs are known for their squishy faces and their charming demeanor. A bit mischievous but beloved by owners, this breed is ideal for laid-back homes and those who like to dote on their pet. Here's what you need to know about living with pugs.</p>
                        <p>Bred as perhaps the original lap dog, pugs thrive on companionship; they're happiest when they can be near their owner. A bit goofy and rambunctious, pugs have also earned a reputation as a canine class clown."They believe that they please you just by being alive and breathing your oxygen," says Pam Nichols, DVM, President-elect of the American Animal Hospital Association.</p>
                        <p>Pugs are ideal house dogs thanks to their stable temperament and loving disposition. Although you'll need a quality vacuum, as they shed profusely! Playful but not requiring lots of activity, pugs are content to do whatever their owner wants to do, whether that be watching a movie or going for a walk around the block. Very intelligent, and at times willful, pugs are happy and affectionate pups who remain very loyal to their 
                        <br> owners.</p>

                    <h2>Royalty</h2>
                        <p>Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century. Similar dogs were popular in the Imperial court during the Song Dynasty.</p>
                        <p>In ancient times, pugs were bred to be companions for ruling families in China. The pet pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs were kept in luxury and guarded by soldiers.</p>
                        <p>The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.</p>
                        <p>Pugs were popular at European courts, and reportedly became the official dog of the House of Orange in 1572 after a pug named Pompey saved the life of the Prince of Orange by alerting him to the approach of assassins.</p>
